Date: 6/10/20

The purpose of this program is to write a function, accept the amount of the purchase,
the cash coupon, the percent coupon,
and it will calculate and return the total order item.

They offer two types of discounts.
The first is cash-off coupons, that you earn by shoppings.
You may apply one $5 or $10 cash off per order.
The second is percent discount coupons for 10%, 15%, or 20% off.
If you have cash-off coupons, those must be applied first,
then apply the percent discount coupons on the pre-tax amount.
Then you add tax at 6% and shipping according to these guidelines:
